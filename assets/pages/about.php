<h2>About us</h2>
<p>We are basically the continuation of CCM modding<br>
We are a primarily open source developers crew.</br>
Our main focus is Minecraft mods, but we are working on other things too. Shhhh!</br>
We like open source because it promotes collaboration.</br>
If you want to join us, feel free to message us or make a pull request.</br>
We don't use capes for our developers/testers/sponsors, we give them <a href="?p=perks">other things.</a></p>
